This assignment involves processing large CSV files extracted from Stack Overflow data to count occurrences of specific keywords. We have two scripts:

- **count_python.sh**: Counts the number of lines containing the word "Python" in the dataset.
- **count_github.py**: Counts the number of lines containing the word "GitHub" in the dataset.
